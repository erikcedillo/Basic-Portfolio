    <h1>About Me</h1>

<img src="" class="image" >
<p>My name is Erik Cedillo and I'm eighteen years old. I am kinda shy but once you get to know me I am actually a jokester. I recently graudted from Grossmont High School and I will be attending Grossmont College where I will try and get my career as a web developer. I love computers and cars I always wanted a job that I could do something with computers. I was introduced to coding in High school and I loved but I didn't really learn a lot of coding languages. We had so many people that worked in the computer science industry come to our class. They talked about what they do in their company and one of the speakers that caught my attetion said that he didn't have to his office all week he only went to the office once a week and the rest was to work from home. That's why I wanted to get into bootcamp to find a job in the computer science indusryt after the program.
